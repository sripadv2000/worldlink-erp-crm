# ==================================================
# IDURAR ERP/CRM Frontend - Production Environment
# ==================================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# These variables are injected at BUILD TIME by Vite

# ==================================================
# BACKEND CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED)
# ==================================================
# Backend Server URL - Set this to your deployed backend URL
# Must include trailing slash
# Example: https://your-backend-service-abc123.run.app/
VITE_BACKEND_SERVER="https://your-backend-service.run.app/"

# File Base URL (usually same as backend server)
# This is where uploaded files are served from
VITE_FILE_BASE_URL="https://your-backend-service.run.app/"

# ==================================================
# FRONTEND CONFIGURATION (OPTIONAL)
# ==================================================
# Frontend URL - Optional, will use window.location.origin if not set
# Example: https://your-frontend-service-xyz789.run.app/
# VITE_FRONTEND_URL="https://your-frontend-service.run.app/"

# ==================================================
# DEVELOPMENT MODE
# ==================================================
# Set to 'remote' to use remote backend during development
# Leave unset or set to 'local' for local development
# VITE_DEV_REMOTE="remote"

# ==================================================
# BUILD TIME vs RUNTIME VARIABLES
# ==================================================
# IMPORTANT: Vite environment variables are embedded at BUILD TIME
# For Cloud Run deployment with dynamic URLs:
#
# Option 1: Build with specific URLs (recommended for production)
#   - Set VITE_BACKEND_SERVER during docker build
#   - Docker build command:
#     docker build --build-arg VITE_BACKEND_SERVER=https://your-backend.run.app/ -t frontend .
#
# Option 2: Runtime injection (advanced)
#   - Use placeholder values that get replaced at container startup
#   - Requires custom docker-entrypoint.sh script
#
# ==================================================
# CLOUD RUN DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ==================================================
# 1. Frontend uses NGINX and serves static files
# 2. All API calls go directly to backend URL (no proxy)
# 3. Make sure CORS is properly configured on backend
# 4. VITE_BACKEND_SERVER must match your deployed backend URL
# 5. Both frontend and backend should use HTTPS in production
